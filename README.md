# 🚲 PADELX

A **PADELX** is designed to enhance safety in **peer-to-peer bicycle sharing** at Sri Lankan tourist destinations.  

This project is part of my **university research** and focuses on building a **non-IoT prototype** that can later be extended with IoT features.


## 📱 Features
- View available bikes (list view)  
- Book a bike with simple form validation  
- Safety instructions for riders  
- Incident reporting form (accident/theft)  


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Flutter, Dart  
- **Backend (optional):** Mock Data / Firebase (future work)  
- **UI/UX:** Inspired by Figma designs
